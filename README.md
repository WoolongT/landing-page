# landing-page
Hub for the landing page project (The Odin Project)

This is my first shot at creating a full website using "proper" coding technique, and I can wholeheartedly admit 
I feel as though I have NO idea what i'm doing lol (at least in the context of container/item spacing structure.) 
I've been working on this landing page for a few days and have been picking up on tons of new information, as well
as a few "aha!" moments when something I learned from the past finally clicks. This process hasn't always been 
as magical. There have been a few days where I was too burnt out to look for solutions and other days where I just
wasn't in the mood to put code in, but i'm learning that the good and the bad are all part of the hurdles of learning 
web development. I plan on becoming intimate with my inspirations for wanting to take this challenge, as well as what
I would be interested in building as a way to offset the study fatigue. Till next time!
