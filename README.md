This is my first shot at creating a full website using "proper" coding technique, and I can wholeheartedly admit 
I feel as though I have NO idea what i'm doing lol (at least in the context of container/item spacing structure.) 
I've been working on this landing page for a few days and have been picking up on tons of new information, as well
as a few "aha!" moments when something I learned from the past finally clicks. This process hasn't always been 
as magical. There have been a few days where I was too burnt out to look for solutions and other days where I just
wasn't in the mood to put code in, but i'm learning that the good and the bad are all part of the hurdles of learning 
web development. I plan on becoming intimate with my inspirations for wanting to take this challenge, as well as what
I would be interested in building as a way to offset the study fatigue. Till next time!

Additions have been a bit slow, and understanding how to use flexbox effectively has been a pain, so i decided to start
practicing with a mastery game called "Flexbox Zombies". This game is a godsend, it teaches you the functions of the 
different elements and their properties in a fun way. My understanding of exactly how to use the display containers
has increased twice over. Will have to find more games like this that help ease the process.

After 21 days of growing pains, many flexbox tutorials and coffee breaks, today is the day i've finally complteted this project! There are still spacing issues that have to be addressed and I also want to replace the placeholder items with content to relfect a professional web-page, but i'll get to that further down the road. My main obstacle in completing this landing page was understanding how flexbox functions and what each of the selectors are capable of. A few fun minigames and MDN articles for a few days has mostly cleared up this confusion, but am still working on solidifying my knowledge (shoutout to Flexbox Zombies!) Other issues were: figuring out proper sizes for text/divs, header/footer sizing + placement (needs work), proper code management, flexbox containers, content spacing and figuring out how to merge branches with git (almost got me there!) Onto the next project!
